Funnel Sans and Funnel Display are modern sans-serifs with both clarity and character, originally developed by NORD ID and Kristian MÃ¶ller for Funnel. The typefaces are inspired by the movement and shapes of data points. Funnel Sans is a functional yet personal sans serif with both square and circular shapes in the letterforms. In Funnel Display some parts of the stem is shifted, to enhance the sense of movement even more.
